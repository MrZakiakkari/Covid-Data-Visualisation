## Task:

Using the Covid Data sourced at https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data. ;  You can use other related data in that set such as the vaccine rollout data or whatever is an interesting story to tell.   So, first spend time looking at the data and find the story.  Ideas are is there a relationship to GDP and Age Expectancy/Covid Infection Rates/Vaccine Rates?  Is there a relationship between population density and infection/vaccine rates?  Is there a trend across the different continents?  Can you show the timeline, with charts that show how infection/vaccination has progressed?  

Create a webpage that contains a minimum of three different chart types and explanatory text to describe the key points you see in the data.   The charts should be of different chart types and may include a bubble chart, geochart, line charts bar charts etc.  You may use more than three charts if you wish, and if necessary to the story you wish to tell.  So for example you might want to create a timeline and show the geochart as the virus spread over six-month intervals, therefore you would need x number of geocharts for that element of the story, but they only count as one type.  The charts should be well-designed, labelled, using legends, axis headings as appropriate.  

Grades will be given for well designed page that flows well with descriptive text, and use of good visual encoding on the page.  

You should submit the HTML file, clearly labelled with your student name, student number, course name, assignment number, and date.  The spreadsheet which supplies the chart data should be uploaded to your google sheets accounts and shared so that I can view it.

Google Sheets might limit the size of the dataset, if so, download the file to Excel or into a database, and export upload to Google Sheets just the data you need.  

The structure of the page should be author-driven, and follow a Kabob  or News writing narrative format.  Use newspaper articles as a guide for layout such as https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html

The visualizations and article should be written for the general public.  This article may feature in your portfolio of work done, so you need to make it as professional as possible.   So your text should not refer to "assignment", "I chose this chart because.." "I wanted to see..."  Use a professional writing style that explores the story in your visuals.  

You should write your name, course, assignment number, and lecturer name as comments at the top of the HTML page. Also you page should be labelled `yourname_ass1.html`

## Marking Rubic

Pass Grade:  A well designed webpage with at least three different charts types, one of which uses iFrames to pull in data.  Data made available to share on Google Sheets .  Appropriate chart types should have been used.  Charts make good use of visual encodings so are visually pleasing.  Code labelled with student and assignment details.

Honour Grade:  A well designed webpage with at least three different charts types, one of which uses iFrames to pull in data.  Data made available to share on Google Sheets.  Appropriate chart types should have been used.     Code labelled with student and assignment details.  Code commented.  Interesting story told in the data.  Text blocks tell the story of the data in an engaging manner.  Webpage is well styled and grabs attention.  Charts make good use of visual encodings and are properly labelled and referenced.  Good use of colour chosen.
