    <p>This graph indicates the total cases of Covid-19 reported from different dates from January/2020 to July/2021. When hovering over the graph between different date zones we can the maximum number of cases of Covid-19 that are either increased or decreased depending on the number of people who are fully vaccinated or infected by Covid-19. This is due to the gatherings of people for different events(such as Christmas or work or etc.) from differnt regions who are either reckless or do not notice the consequences of Covid-19 and some would say that Covid is not real. </p>

    <p>This graph shows the number of new deaths that were decreased from the new cases of covid due to the deliverable of vaccinations and adding restrictions specically for Covid-19. When hovering over this scatterplot we see the maximum number of deaths that were decreased from the new Covid cases that were recently occured. Although some deaths may still occur from Covid at least the graph proves there is still a chance to not only decrease but also to prevent deaths from Covid due to vaccines as well as people following restrictions although the chances are slim the main importance are for people to follow safety rules and avoid covid.</p>
